Prediction of Diseases using machine learning algorithms
###This repository holds an attempt to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms on two dataset.And also attempts to build web app to predict the likelihood of a person having these disease based on the given datasets. The datasets are used are "Diabetes Dataset"( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set) and "Heart Failure Prediction Dataset" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
