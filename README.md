# Prediction of Diseases using machine learning algorithms

This repository holds an attempt to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms on two dataset.And also attempts to build web app using streamlit to predict the likelihood of a person having these disease based on the given datasets. The datasets are used are "Diabetes Dataset"( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set) and "Heart Failure Prediction Dataset" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)

# Overview

The "Diabetes Dataset" contains the diagnosis of females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage based on factors like Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI,DiabetesPedigreeFunction,Age. The outcomes are described as 0 or 1 with 0 being tested negative for diabetes and 1 being tested positive for diabetes.

The other Dataset used in this repository is "Heart Failure Prediction Dataset"  which is combinatiion of 5 heart disease datasets . The dataset contains a diagnosis of patients based on factors like Age,Sex,ChestPainType,RestingBP,Cholesterol,FastingBS,RestingECG,maximum heart rate achieved,ExerciseAngina,Oldpeak and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment.The diagnosis are described as 0 0r 1 with 0 being not having heart failture and 1 being having heart failture.

# Summary of Workdone

Data: 

Type:
        
        Input: The datasets are csv files that have 8 attrubute for the diabetes dataset and 11 atributes for heart failture dataset.
 
 Size: 
         The "Heart Failure Prediction Dataset" dataset have 918 instances and "Diabetes Dataset" have 768 instances. In both dataset 33% was used as a test data and the remaining were used as train.
